Overview
--------
wtforms-nocaptcha is a convenient field for `WTForms <http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/>`_ that transparently handles
Google's No Captcha reCaptcha display and validation via corresponding widget and validator classes.


Installation
------------
Get the distribution::

  pip install wtforms-nocaptcha


Usage
-----
It is mostly the usual WTForms field that needs some extra data and parameters.
Here's a simple example::

  from wtforms.form import Form
  from wtfnocaptcha.fields import NoCaptchaField


  class CaptchaForm(Form):
      captcha = NoCaptchaField(public_key=RECAPTCHA_PUB_KEY, private_key=RECAPTCHA_PRIV_KEY, secure=True)


  form = CaptchaForm(request.POST, captcha={'ip_address': request.META['REMOTE_ADDR']})
  if form.validate():
      print "Captcha response is correct"
  else:
      print form.errors['captcha']


Some description of field's parameters:

:public_key:
    Public key generated by reCaptcha service
:private_key:
    Private key generated by reCaptcha service
:secure:
    True if it should be served via HTTPS, False otherwise. Default: *False*.
:http_proxy:
    URL of HTTP proxy for API calls

When form with RecaptchaField is instantiated with bound fields, it must include
*captcha* keyword parameter with dict that has 'ip_address' element.


Other details
-------------
Accessing field as a string will get the widget code with URLs that depend on
*secure* parameter passed to the field.

HTTP errors and errors that are indepentent of user input are logged.
Others are handled as validation errors.
